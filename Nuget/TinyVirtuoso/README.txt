====================================

The TinyVirtuoso can be used to deploy an embedded version of the OpenLink Virtuoso database.

What are the next steps?
--------------------------

First you need to decide wheter you want to deploy your application for Windows or OSX (sorry we don't support Linux at the moment).
Then you need to add the appropriate NuGet packages to your project.

Windows: TinyVirtuos.win
OSX: TinyVirtuos.osx
