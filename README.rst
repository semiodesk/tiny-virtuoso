Overview

This package is intended to lower the entry barrier for developers to try out Semantic Web technologies.
The goals are:
- Easy setup, just add a nuget package
- Simple first steps, a few short lines of code should be enough to get database up and running
- Easy to use, with a focus on `Semiodesk.Trinity`_, the developer can start working with Semantic Web technologies with only little knowledge.

The software is supported by `Semiodesk`_.
